My name is Marcin Szlagor. I'm a software developer interested in JVM languages and frameworks.  
My programming adventure started when I was thirteen (1996). Since then I was working on many operating systems, using many different programming languages and numerous frameworks. 
For quite a long time I felt the need to be close to operating system creating small/lightweight applications (WinAPI) and device drivers.  
Seven years ago I fell in love in Java. Currently my special point of interest is Grails framework and it's language Groovy.  
  
My field of interests are:  
- software craftsmanship  
- testing  
- continues integration  
- functional languages  
- social media  
- SEO  

### Life

I'm also interested in Arduino and similar technologies. Everything with a DIY in the name holds my sight for longer.  
After long sitting sessions by the desk I like to stretch my body. I really enjoy volleyball and table tennis. Since half of the year I'm also attending Karate Kyokushin dojo.
